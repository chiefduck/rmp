### ✅ Phase 2 Complete - CRM Foundation
- **Improved AddClientModal**: 3-step wizard with validation
  - Step 1: Basic client info (name, email, phone)
  - Step 2: Loan details (amount, rate, credit score, type)
  - Step 3: Notes and summary
  - Real-time form validation (email format, phone digits, credit score ranges)
  - Proper input backgrounds and visual feedback

- **Enhanced ClientDetailsModal**: Full note management
  - Add/delete client notes with timestamps
  - Different note types (general, stage_change, call, email, meeting)

  - Proper confirmation dialogs

- **Client Management**: Complete CRUD operations

  - Proper foreign key relationships and cascading

### 🎯 Phase 3 Goal - Two-Section CRM Pipeline
- **Rate Monitor Section**: Closed deals for refi tracking
- **Active Pipeline Section**: Drag-and-drop kanban board
- Volume tracking and analytics dashboard
- Smart automations and rate alerts

### 🛡️ Phase 4 Goal - Pre-Launch Production Checklist
- **Code Cleanup**: Remove all console.logs and debug code
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper error tracking (Sentry/LogRocket)
- **Performance Optimization**: Code splitting, lazy loading, bundle analysis
- **Security Audit**: Remove hardcoded keys, verify RLS policies, test auth flows
- **Production Logging**: Environment-based logging strategy
- **User Experience**: Toast notifications, loading states, error boundaries
- **Testing**: End-to-end testing, edge cases, mobile responsiveness
- **Monitoring**: Analytics setup, performance monitoring, uptime checks
- **Documentation**: API docs, deployment guide, troubleshooting guide

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React + Vite + TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with glassmorphism effects
- **Backend**: Supabase (auth, database, edge functions)
- **Payments**: Stripe (billing, webhooks, customer portal)
- **Rate Data**: Python scraping from Mortgage News Daily

## 🔧 Current User Flow
1. **Signup** → Email verification → Onboarding billing page
2. **14-day trial** starts automatically → User explores features
3. **Subscribe anytime** → Stripe checkout → Active subscription
4. **CRM Management**: Add clients, manage notes, track pipeline
5. **Cancel through** Stripe portal (remains active until period end)
